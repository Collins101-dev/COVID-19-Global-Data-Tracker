# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

**Track, analyze, and visualize the global progression of the COVID-19 pandemic with real-world data.** 🌍📊

---

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes the **Our World in Data (OWID)** COVID-19 dataset to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's spread, its effects on global health, and the vaccination progress across several countries. Specifically, it focuses on **Kenya, India, and the United States**.

The analysis covers:
- **Cases and deaths over time** 📈
- **Vaccination rollouts and percentages** 💉
- **Country-specific comparisons** 🌎

---

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Cleaned, processed, and visualized global COVID-19 data.
- **Comparative Insights:** Compare metrics like total cases, deaths, and vaccinations between countries.
- **Trend Visualization:** Track changes over time with line charts and heatmaps.
- **Interactive Maps (Optional):** Visualize global vaccination rates with Plotly choropleths.

### 📦 Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `pandas` — for data handling
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` — for static visualizations
- `plotly` — for interactive maps
- `jupyter` — for running the analysis in a Jupyter notebook

### ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Collins101-dev/ COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker.git
     cd COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker
   ```

2.Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

3.Install dependencies:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the analysis in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/covid_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## 🖼️ Project Output

The notebook will display the following:

Graphs:

Total COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

Vaccination progress compared across countries.

Maps:

An optional choropleth map showing vaccination rates globally.

Insights:

Key findings and a summary report of the pandemic trends.

## 📊 Sample Output
Total Cases Over Time: Track how different countries' infection rates evolved.

Vaccination Trends: Visualize the percentage of populations fully vaccinated across nations.

Country Comparisons: View the stark differences in cases and deaths between countries like India, the US, and Kenya.

## 📄 Insights
By the end of the project, you’ll be able to identify:

How vaccination rates correlate with declining death rates.

Which countries experienced the fastest vaccine rollouts.

The overall impact of COVID-19 across various regions.

## 🤖 Future Enhancements
Add regional comparisons (e.g., EU vs. Africa).

Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash for real-time data exploration.

Integrate hospitalization and variant-specific data for deeper insights.

## 🌱 Acknowledgments
